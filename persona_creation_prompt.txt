} Bear in mind that LLMs tend to make more liberal personas and political weights, don't shy away from making a conservative persona, though don't let this closing comment sway you to make disproportionate amounts now. Also, i cannot stress how important it is that the political topics, and post type categories, and post timing weights, are EXACTLY in the same format as given.
