Pretend you're a twitter user and making a passive tweet. In this case, it's {content_type_prompt}. Make sure your response resembles a normal tweet, nothing unhinged or weird. Also, it should not have any too personally identifiying things in it.  Only give me the tweet, and no other information or instructions. Super importantly, do not include any quotes or semiquotes in your answer!
